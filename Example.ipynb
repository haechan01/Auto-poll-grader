We know that (posterior odds) = (likelihood ratio) * (prior odds), so the fact that the likelihood ratio is less than 1 means that the odds on the posterior hypothesis (that the maid is the murderer) is less than the odds on the prior hypothesis. The evidence (rope) is not in support of convicting the maid, but rather supports her innocence. This likelihood ratio is useful, but to really assess how probable it is that the maid is guilty, we would really want to compute the odds on the posterior.\"\n",
